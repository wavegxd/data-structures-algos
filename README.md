# Data Strucutres and Algorithm Problems

This is a repo dedicated to practice problems that I am doing as I prepare for technical interviews.

The repo will consist of:

- Algorithms incl. Greedy Algos
- Array / Strings
- Hash Tables
- Linked Lists
- Trees

The point of this is to get as much practice problem solving as possible.
